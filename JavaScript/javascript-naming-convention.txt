In most frontend / Node.js projects you’ll see mainly:

	1.	kebab-case (recommended for general JS files)
	•	Example: app.js, user-service.js, form-handler.js
	•	All lowercase, words separated by -
	•	Very common in web projects and npm packages.

	2.	camelCase (less common for files, common for variables/functions)
	•	Example: userService.js, formHandler.js
	•	Some teams use this, but kebab-case is more standard for file names.

	3.	PascalCase (often for React / classes / components)
	•	Example: UserCard.jsx, HomePage.js, LoginForm.js
	•	Used when the file exports a component or class with the same name.
