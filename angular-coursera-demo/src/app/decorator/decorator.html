<p class="hint">
  This page demonstrates common Angular decorators:
  <b>@Component</b>, <b>@Input</b>, <b>@Output</b>.

<!--
  "Parent area" (simulated):
  Normally, parent->child means:
    Parent template: <app-child [data]="x" (event)="handler($event)"></app-child>

  But for your learning project, keep app.html clean.
  So we demonstrate the idea inside this routed page:
-->

<section class="box">
  <h3>Simulated Parent Area</h3>
  <p>
    In real projects, the parent component provides data and listens to events.
    Here, we show the concepts without touching <code>app.html</code>.
  </p>

  <!--
    Output demo:
    In a true parent, you'd bind: (liked)="onLiked($event)"
    Because we are inside one component file right now, we will just show the
    "child action" and display the result locally.
  -->
  <button (click)="onLikeClick()">Click (Child action)</button>

  <p class="result">
    Likes: {{ likesCount }}
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    When you click, the component method runs, updates state, and Angular updates the DOM.
    (If a parent were listening, it would also receive an @Output event.)
  </p>

  <h3>Quick Summary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>@Component</b>: tells Angular this class controls a piece of UI.</li>
    <li><b>@Input()</b>: parent passes data into the child (like function parameters).</li>
    <li><b>@Output()</b>: child sends an event back to parent (like callbacks).</li>
  </ul>
